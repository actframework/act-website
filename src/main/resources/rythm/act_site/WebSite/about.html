    Long story, back in the end of 2009, I (Gelin Luo, Author of ActFramework) just finished a
    project in CakePHP as an individual consultant, feel pretty frustrated with PHP and decide
    to get back to the Java world. I was still not happy with Struts/w Spring and was hunting
    for other Java MVC frameworks. PlayFramework comes into my sight and I fell in love with it
    at my first try.
</p>
<p>
    I love PlayFramework v1.x because it is simple, clear and expressive. It brought us a completely
    different experience in web development with Java. However I don't totally agree with where
    Play 2.X is heading for, and it looks like I am not the only person with the concern as per this

    I <a target="_blank" href="http://software-lgl.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/thinking-about-creating-new-java-web.html">
    have thought</a> of rolling out something that could follow the road paved by Play 1.x, something that
    is simple, clear, expressive and Java (specifically) developer friendly. About one and half year after
    that I decide I could start the project seriously, and as a result, here comes out this ACT framework,
    a framework that I can call it "a Final Fantasy of Java web developer"
</p>
<p>
    In short, we need a modern, sleek and mainstream Java MVC framework that you don't get from
    Spring MVC/PlayFramework/SparkFramework and many others on the market
